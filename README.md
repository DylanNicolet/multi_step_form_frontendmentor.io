## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) - JS library
- [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) - Store system for Vue.js


### What I learned

This was my first attempt at creating a full Vue app with Pinia as store. This project has helped me learn all the quirks and possibilities the hard way.

It is not the most optimised code or the best solution out there, but it works and will allow me to build a solid ground for my futur Vue projects. 
### Useful resources

- [Vue.js 3 Tutorial on Youtube by 'The Net Ninja'](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hYYGbV60Vq3IXYNfDk8At1) - This series of videos helped me understand Vue.js in the most simple way possible, very recommended.
